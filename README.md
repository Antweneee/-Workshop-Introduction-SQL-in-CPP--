# -Workshop-introduction-SQL-in-CPP-

The purpose of this workshop is to learn how to use sql file with c++


## Step 00 install packages :grey_exclamation:

:exclamation: don't forget to update all your packages before installing SQLite package

Forget the .tar package or the .zip package and try to find an easiest way to download SQLit


## Step 01 Getting Started

In this Step were are going to open our first SQL database with C++,
With this step you will be able to interact with your database, we will see in the next step how to manipulate our database.

Here is the link to the documentation 
- https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html


Here are some hints for this step, variable of type sqlite3 can be usefull, maybe try to open you database file, don't forget to close it tho' :)


## Step 02 Create DataBase

In this step we are going to actually create the SQL table that we will use in the next step of this workshop.
But first take a look at SQL table and how to create it
here is a link to an example of SQK table. - https://sql.sh/cours/create-table - 
Now that you know how a SQL table look like go and see how to create how.

Here is an hint for the code, look for a way to execute SQL instance with c++


## Step 03 Insertion 

Hello there :) if you are here that mean that you successfully opened your database file, and you even created your own data base ! 
We are now going to insert data in our database, because a database wihout anything is pretty useless anyway.
To do that again we are going to need an insert method from SQL.
At this point execute SQL command with c++ is maybe the same as before so try to do that again but with the insert command.


## Step 04 Read our Table

Hi again this is one of the last step of this workshop we are now going get information from our datatable.
There is a method in SQL wich is use especially for this do some research and try to get some usefull information in your table or even all the info in it !
Again once you've find the SQL method to get data from table execute your SQL command with C++


## Step 05 A little bit of everything

Now that you've learn how to manipulate your database let's try to do something harder.
Try to make a calendar for meeting with SQL tables, you don't have to do a front for this just create some table wich contain information about people, their firstname, lastname, age, job etc and maybe a table for the meeting with some infos about it, a date, a place, people participating to the meeting.
And try to put it all together by printing it.

Have Fun.
